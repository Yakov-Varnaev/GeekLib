    description: Atlas Shrugged is a 1957 novel by Ayn Rand. Her fourth and final
      novel, it was also her longest, and the one she considered to be her magnum
      opus in the realm of fiction writing. Atlas Shrugged includes elements of science
      fiction, mystery, and romance, and it contains Rand's most extensive statement
      of Objectivism in any of her works of fiction. Rand described the theme of Atlas
      Shrugged as "the role of man's mind in existence". The book explores a number
      of philosophical themes from which Rand would subsequently develop Objectivism,
      including reason, individualism, and capitalism, and depicts what Rand saw as
      the failures of governmental coercion.

    description: The Fountainhead is a 1943 novel by Russian-American author Ayn Rand,
      her first major literary success. The novel's protagonist, Howard Roark, is
      an intransigent young architect, who battles against conventional standards
      and refuses to compromise with an architectural establishment unwilling to accept
      innovation. Roark embodies what Rand believed to be the ideal man, and his struggle
      reflects Rand's belief that individualism is superior to collectivism.
